# HTB-Box-Setup-Script

## What does the script do?
  * Creates a dir called \<machine-name\> or \<fortress-name\>
  * Creates a dir called nmap inside the dir
  * Creates and opens a new cherry-tree document for you to take notes
  * Opens a new tmux session for you

## What more do I want it to do?
  * I'm contemplating if I need to make a dir for gobuster/fuff/any-web-discovery-script because not all HTB machines use web
  * Add nodes to cherry tree?
